                                                         QUESTION S BASED ON JAVA::-->>
 1>.  "MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS ACHIEVED BY IMPLEMENTING INTERFACES" JUSTIFY?
 ANS-  
       interface abstracct class ka baap h bole to                                                              WHY WE USE INTERFACE>
> interface is an abstract class which havent the body definition ..                            1.  to achieve multiple inheritance
> it is uswd to achieve abstraction                                                             2.  to achieve abstraction
                                   interface shape                                              3.  loose coupling
                               {
                                   void area();
                               }
                                  interface figure
                               {
                                 void perimeter();
                               }
                              interface circle extends shape,figure
                               {
                               }
2> EXPLAIN THE PROCESS OF CREATING MULTIPLE THREADS USING RUNNABLE INTERFACE?
ANS.  we can create multpiple threads by two ways:
       (1) extending thread
       (2) using runnable interface
   class mythread implemements runnable
{
  void run()
  {
    for(int i=1;i<=5;i++)
     {
       system.out.println(i);
     }
  }   
}
class mythreaddemo
{
  mythread th1=new mythread();
  thread th=new thread(th1);
  th.start();
}
